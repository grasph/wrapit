# WrapIt! ROOT example

## Introduction

This directory contains an advanced usage example of WrapIt!. It is similar to the registered [ROOT.jl](https://github.com/JuliaHEP/ROOT.jl) package, that is built with WrapIt!, but supporting a subset of the `ROOT` classes supported by `ROOT.jl`.

The [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/) software is a central software framework in High energy physics research developed in C++ at [CERN](http://www.cern.ch). The framework has some similarities with Julia although it is not a programming language: its provide a REPL with a C++ interpreter based on [LLVM](http://llvm.org); like Julia it can also be used from Jupyter notebooks. It has a Python interface, [PyROOT](https://root.cern.ch/manual/python/) which is very popular among the physicist. The [ROOT.jl](https://github.com/JuliaHEP/ROOT.jl) provides an interface for old Julia versions (<=1.3.0) using the [Cxx.jl](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/Cxx.jl) interface. 

The [ROOT.jl](https://github.com/JuliaHEP/ROOT.jl)w package provides a Julia interface to this framework built with WrapIt!. The example contained in this directory is a similar, but limited to a subset of ROOT classed covered by ROOT.jl. It is faster to compile

In this example, we will use ROOT library functionalities from Julia via an interface generated with WrapIt!.

We will create a histogram, fill it with random numbers drawn according to a normal distribution, fit the histogram, plot the result --shown in the image below--, display it on screen and save the result  in a ROOT-format file. All of these actions will be done using the ROOT library.

You will also find examples, that write and read TTree, in [TTree_examples](TTree_examples).

## Prerequisite

This example needs to have the ROOT software [installed](https://root.cern/install/) on your computer or have access to it via [cvmfs](https://cernvm.cern.ch/fs/).

Depending on the installation mode, you may need to source the `thisroot.sh` to set up your shell environment and provide access to the ROOT binaries.

## Code generation and compilation of the shared library

```
make all
```

ðŸ’¡ The above command runs WrapIt! to generate the c++ code with the command:
```
wrapit ROOT.wit
```
and then it builds the shared library from the generated `jlROOT.cxx` file.

## Use of the wrapper.

As the package is not installed in the system and is only in the current directory, you need to add this directory to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH (used for the shared library) and JULIA_LOAD_PATH (used for the Julia module) environment variable. You can source the `setup.sh` files (`setup.csh` if your shell is tcsh or csh) to perform this.

```
source setup.sh
```

Note: when plotting a new histogram, you may need to click on the graphics to update the display.

The usage example can be found in the [demo_ROOT.jl](demo_ROOT.j) file reproduced below.


```julia
#Import the module.
# The iROOT module is required for interactive graphic display
# Loading the package trigger a loop that process ROOT graphic events.
using ROOT
using iROOT

# Create a ROOT histogram, fill it with random events, and fit it.
h = ROOT.TH1D("h", "Normal distribution", 100, -5., 5.)
ROOT.FillRandom(h, "gaus")

#Draw the histogram on screen
c = ROOT.TCanvas()
ROOT.Draw(h)

#Fit the histogram wih a normal distribution
ROOT.Fit(h, "gaus")

#Save the Canvas in an image file
ROOT.SaveAs(c, "demo_ROOT.png")

#Save the histogram and the graphic canvas in the demo_ROOT_out.root file.
f = ROOT.TFile!Open("demo_ROOT_out.root", "RECREATE")
ROOT.Write(h)
ROOT.Write(c)
Close(f)
```
